Hi! I am an incoming Assistant Professor at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Dept of Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/) (starting in Aug, 2025). My research focuses on the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI), human-centered artificial intelligence (HAI), and usable security and privacy, with a special emphasis on vulnerable populations.

I lead the `OATS Lab` (Openness, Autonomy, Trust in Supportive AI). As AI becomes increasingly integrated into the smart devices we use daily, sophisticated algorithms analyze our data to evaluate personal characteristics and make impactful decisions. In this digital environment, smart devices have evolved from functional tools to active agents shaping our online experiences and futures. At OATS Lab, we thrive to rethink how AI can be made more autonomy-supportive for individual users, particularly focusing on more vulnerable populations such as children, young people, and other marginalized communities.

I will be doing a one-year postdoctoral fellowship at [Stanford HAI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) from 2024 to 2025 before starting my faculty appointment. I received my D.Phil (Ph.D.) in Computer Science from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford and completed my Master's (MSc) in Information Science at UCL. I did my undergraduate studies in Physics at the University of Oxford.

`I have multiple openings for PhDs/Postdocs starting Fall 2025. I always love to work with self-motivated undergraduates, graduate students on various research projects on human-centered AI / usable privacy & security. Shoot me an email if you are interested!`
