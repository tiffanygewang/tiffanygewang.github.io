<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Hi! I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Siebel School of Computing and Data Science</a>. My research focuses on the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI), human-centered artificial intelligence (HAI), and usable security and privacy, with a special emphasis on vulnerable populations.</p> <p>I lead the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OATS Lab</code> (Openness, Autonomy, Trust in Supportive AI). As AI becomes increasingly integrated into the smart devices we use daily, sophisticated algorithms analyze our data to evaluate personal characteristics and make impactful decisions. In this digital environment, smart devices have evolved from functional tools to active agents shaping our online experiences and futures. At OATS Lab, we strive to rethink how AI can be made more autonomy-supportive for individual users, empowering them to assert their agency against various algorithmic decisions made about them – with a special focus on more vulnerable populations, such as children, young people, and other marginalized communities.</p> <p>Prior to UIUC, I was an HAI postdoc fellow at <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Stanford HAI</a> from 2024 to 2025. I received my D.Phil (Ph.D.) in Computer Science from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford and completed my Master’s (MSc) in Information Science at UCL. I did my undergraduate studies in Physics at the University of Oxford.</p> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I always love to work with self-motivated undergraduates, graduate students on various research projects on human-computer interaction / human-centered AI. Shoot me an email if you are interested!</code></p> </body></html>
